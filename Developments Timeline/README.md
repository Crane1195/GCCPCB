# Developments Timeline

## August 2018

I built this first controller using an Arduino, a logic level shifter, and a permanently attached cable. Here is a link to a build-log for this controller:

I then transferred some of the first controller's parts into this aluminum/acrylic case, and upgraded to a detachable RJ45 cable. Here is a build-log for this controller:

I wanted to consolidate the circuit onto a single board in order to increase functionality as well as to make these controllers easier to build.

So, I designed a controller circuit using the Native USB compatible Arduino Micro and a USB type C port that would allow for much higher quality cables compared to RJ45.

I started learning how to use KiCAD and designed this board, the GCCPCB. After assembling one, I found many errors, I forgot a couple traces, and had a couple traces going to the wrong pins. Despite this I was able to get the board working with a bit of trace splicing and cutting.

I didn't actually have a controller to use this board in, so I quickly designed and 3D printed this case, which uses MX form factor switches. I used Kailh Speed Silver switches, and hand wired them to my board. This is the first controller I designed which used MX like switches, and it inspired later better designs.

I fixed the issues of the previous prototype, and ordered a small run of these to sell.

I wanted to apply my CAD skills and the new PCB to a controller, so I designed a laser cuttable case in Autodesk Inventor, and made this wood controller.

I returned to the idea of a controller using MX form factor switches designing a PCB to contain the circuit and switches. This had it's own assortment of shortcomings, but it was a massive improvement over the previous implementation.

## October 2019 - March 2020

During this period of time, I totally redesigned the GCCPCB to use all basic components as well as increase functionality. I also upgraded my setup with a variable zoom microscope in order to assemble them.

After designing the new GCCPCB, I designed a laser cuttable case to mount a switch PCB and the GCCPCB, which I call the GCCMX. Due to essentially being a solid block of acrylic, this controller is exceptionally rigid.

I finalized the design by switching to a steel switch mounting plate, tweaking the layout, and upgrading the fasteners significantly.

## June 2020 - August 2020

During these months, I assembled and sold 25 of the new GCCPCB model, and 8 GCCMXs.

## August 2020 - Present

I am currently working on an optical switch PCB design, as well as a lower profile, easier to build GCCMX model.
