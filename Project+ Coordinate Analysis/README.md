# Project+ Coordinate Analysis, and How the B0XX Can Function Within P+
## Forward

This document and these graphics were made to apply what is said and shown in the B0XX Melee Instruction Manual to Project+. The graphics shown here replicate the ones present in that manual, as does the order of them. Because of this, I highly recommend reading this alongside the coinciding second in the Melee manual. Each graphic will have the manuals section number beside it to aid in this. Here is a link to the Melee Manual :

There are two reasons why I had to make these graphics and they are the differences between Melee and Project M's (now Project+) coordinate fields.
- The coordinate axes' range in Melee is -80 to 80, where in P+ the range is -100 to 100.
- Actions have different zones in P+ compared to Melee.

Since the range is -100 to 100, the proportion that is commonly used in Melee to express analog values will now conveniently align with how many pixels away from neutral the coordinate is.
